# Statistics_and_Data_Analysis

This repository is part of the Statistics and Data Analysis course in the MS.c studies in Computer Science. It includes four Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) that cover various topics in statistics and data analysis.

Distributions.ipynb:
This notebook covers the concept of probability distributions, including discrete and continuous distributions. It discusses important distributions such as the normal distribution, binomial distribution, Poisson distribution, and more. Additionally, the notebook covers mixture distributions and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for fitting them. It also includes examples of generating samples from various distributions.

Data_exploration_and_visualization.ipynb:
This notebook focuses on data exploration and visualization. It covers different techniques for exploring and understanding data, including descriptive statistics, graphical analysis, and more.

Correlations.ipynb:
This notebook covers correlation analysis, including Pearson's correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and more. It also discusses how to interpret correlation results and their significance.

Differential_Gene_Expression_in_Acute_Myocardial_Infraction.ipynb:
This notebook is a case study that demonstrates how to analyze gene expression data in the context of acute myocardial infarction. It covers the steps involved in differential gene expression analysis, including data preprocessing, normalization, statistical testing, and more.

The notebooks in this repository are intended to provide a practical understanding of statistical concepts and data analysis techniques. They can be used as a resource for learning or as a reference for applying these techniques to real-world problems.

To run the notebooks in this repository, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer. You can install Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda or Miniconda, or by following the installation instructions on the Jupyter Notebook website.
